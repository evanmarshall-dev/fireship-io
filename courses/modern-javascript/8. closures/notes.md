# Closures

## Notes

Closures are functions that can access values outside of their own curly braces. In order to call a function the JS interpreter needs to know about the function itself and any other data from the surrounding environment that it depends on. Everything needs to be closed up inside a "box" (closure) before it can be fed to the "machine".
